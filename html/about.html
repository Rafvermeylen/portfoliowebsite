            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>My name is Raf Vermeylen, and I am passionate about networks, especially setting up systems with cables.</p>
            <p>I started my journey in 2018 with the goal of becoming an English and IT teacher. In 2020, I shifted my focus fully to IT, particularly in IoT. I hold a degree in IoT and also a VCA diploma.</p>
            <p>While I am still a student of Applied Computer Science at KdG, specializing in System and Network Engineering, I have gained valuable experience through various student jobs.</p>
            <p>I am determined to hone my skills further by working in a firm and potentially freelancing or starting my own firm in the future.</p>

        <section id="education" class="about-section">
            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>My educational journey has been diverse and rewarding. I'm currently pursuing Applied Computer Science at KdG,
                specializing in system and network management, which aligns with my passion for technology and problem-solving.
                Before this, I earned a degree in Internet of Things (IoT), where I delved into the fascinating world of connected
                devices, learning how to integrate technology into everyday life.</p>

            <p>Earlier in my academic path, I aimed to become an English and IT teacher, combining my love for language
                and technology. This experience honed my communication skills and deepened my understanding of IT, which still
                influences my approach to projects today. Additionally, I hold a VCA diploma, reflecting my commitment to safety
                and quality in technical environments.</p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>My journey through various student jobs has been a rich tapestry of experiences, each contributing to my growth
                and skillset. I started working at Delhaize, which taught me valuable customer service and teamwork skills.
                Following that, I worked at a printing factory, gaining hands-on experience with machinery and processes,
                which enhanced my attention to detail.</p>

            <p>Tutoring was a significant part of my career, where I not only helped students with their studies but also
                developed my teaching and mentoring abilities. This role allowed me to see the impact of clear communication
                and personalized guidance.</p>

            <p>Currently, as a personal coach, I continue to apply these skills, providing tailored support and strategies to
                help individuals achieve their goals.</p>

            <p>In terms of significant projects, I’ve worked on a range of technical endeavors. For example, I designed simple
                temperature sensors, which gave me practical experience with hardware and data collection. Additionally, I’ve
                deployed web applications using Google Cloud, where I managed server configurations, integrated databases, and
                ensured the scalability of applications. These projects reflect my capability to handle both hardware and software
                challenges effectively.</p>
