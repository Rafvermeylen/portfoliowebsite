        <h1>Pokémon Battle App</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Pokémon Battle App was an ambitious solo project designed to create an interactive platform where users
            could scan their Pokémon cards and use them to battle other players. The application was meant to bridge the gap
            between physical trading card games and digital gameplay, offering a unique experience for Pokémon enthusiasts.</p>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project involved developing an application where users could scan Pokémon cards into a PostgreSQL database
            using RFID tags. Once scanned, these cards could be read out and were intended to be used in battles against
            other players. Unfortunately, due to time constraints and the complexity of the project, I was unable to fully realize
            the platform or the battling functionality within the 14 week timeframe, which also overlapped with my internship.
            This was also the main reason I wanted to study something extra. That way, I was able to hone in on my software skills
            and be a better IT professional.
        </p>

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>The key objectives of the Pokémon Battle App were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Card Scanning:</strong> To enable users to scan their physical Pokémon cards into a digital database using RFID tags.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> To store the scanned card data securely in a PostgreSQL database.</li>
            <li><strong>Interactive Battles:</strong> To create a platform where scanned cards could be used in digital battles against other players.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
        <p>The project utilized the following technologies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>PostgreSQL:</strong> For storing and managing the scanned Pokémon card data.</li>
            <li><strong>RFID Tags and Readers:</strong> For scanning and identifying the physical Pokémon cards.</li>
            <li><strong>Python:</strong> Used for writing scripts to interact with the database and manage the card data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Project Development</h2>
        <h3>Phase 1: Card Scanning</h3>
        <p>The initial phase focused on developing the functionality to scan Pokémon cards using RFID technology. This included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>RFID Integration:</strong> Successfully integrating RFID readers with the application to scan Pokémon cards.</li>
            <li><strong>Database Setup:</strong> Configuring a PostgreSQL database to store the scanned card information.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Retrieval:</strong> Implementing features to read and retrieve scanned card data from the database.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Phase 2: Platform and Battles (Planned)</h3>
        <p>While the initial phase was completed, the second phase, which involved developing the battling platform, was not realized within the project timeframe. The goals for this phase were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Platform Development:</strong> Creating a user-friendly interface where players could view their scanned cards.</li>
            <li><strong>Battle Logic:</strong> Developing the mechanics for how battles would be conducted using the scanned cards.</li>
            <li><strong>Networking:</strong> Enabling online battles between users by integrating network connectivity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges and Learnings</h2>
        <p>This project presented several challenges, particularly due to the limited timeframe of 14 weeks and the simultaneous demands of my internship. Key learnings include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Time Management:</strong> Balancing multiple responsibilities and setting realistic goals for project milestones.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical Integration:</strong> Gaining experience in integrating hardware (RFID) with software (database and application logic).</li>
            <li><strong>Project Scope:</strong> Understanding the importance of defining a project scope that aligns with available resources and time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion and Future Prospects</h2>
        <p>Although the Pokémon Battle App was not fully completed, the project provided valuable experience in working with RFID technology and database management.
        I have learned a lot through this project and would love to revisit it in the future.</p>
