        <h1>Suivo</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Suivo is a company specializing in Fleet & Asset management, where IoT tags play a crucial role. Suivo offers a wide range of passive and active tags, as well as trackers and mobile devices that function as hubs/gateways. These devices identify tags and transmit any additional sensor data, along with a timestamp, to the central Cloud platform for further processing and reporting to end clients.</p>

        <div class="objective">
            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <p>The primary objectives of the Suivo project were:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hardware Development:</strong> To develop a cost-effective gateway that can detect nearby “short-range” active tags and transmit data to the central platform.</li>
                <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> To ensure reliable Wi-Fi or optional 4G/5G connectivity for real-time data transmission.</li>
                <li><strong>Power Resilience:</strong> To design a system that remains operational for several days during power outages.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="technology">
            <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
            <p>The Suivo project utilized the following technologies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>IoT Tags:</strong> Active BLE tags used to transmit identification data.</li>
                <li><strong>Gateway:</strong> A custom-built gateway capable of detecting BLE broadcasts and sending the data to the cloud.</li>
                <li><strong>Wi-Fi/4G/5G Modules:</strong> Used for establishing connectivity with the Suivo platform.</li>
                <li><strong>Power Management Systems:</strong> Ensures the gateway can operate during power outages.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h2>Project Development</h2>
            <h3>Phase 1: Concept and Design</h3>
            <p>The project began with the conceptualization and design of a gateway capable of detecting active tags and transmitting data to the Suivo platform. This phase included:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Component Selection:</strong> Choosing suitable off-the-shelf components for the gateway, including the modem, power management system, and BLE receiver.</li>
                <li><strong>Design:</strong> Creating the housing design for the gateway, with considerations for in-house production by Suivo.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Phase 2: Development and Prototyping</h3>
            <p>In this phase, the focus was on building a functional prototype of the gateway. Key activities included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hardware Assembly:</strong> Integrating selected components into a working prototype.</li>
                <li><strong>Firmware Development:</strong> Writing and testing the code to enable the gateway to detect tags and send data to the cloud.</li>
                <li><strong>Initial Testing:</strong> Conducting tests to ensure the gateway's functionality in detecting tags and maintaining connectivity.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Phase 3: Testing and Optimization</h3>
            <p>Once the prototype was developed, extensive testing and optimization were conducted to refine the system's performance. This phase included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Range Testing:</strong> Verifying the effective range for detecting BLE tags and optimizing the system accordingly.</li>
                <li><strong>Power Management Optimization:</strong> Ensuring the system could run efficiently on battery power during outages.</li>
                <li><strong>Reliability Testing:</strong> Stress-testing the gateway under various conditions to ensure stable performance.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="challenge">
            <h2>Challenges and Learnings</h2>
